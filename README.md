# Capstone-MachineLearning

This is my Machine Learning Assignment for my capstone project, where I implemented the kNN and decision tree algorithms in Python and tested it on Monks1, Monks2, and Monks3 data.

Here is a summary of the results I was able to achieve with kNN

kNN

On Practice Data Provided by the Professor
  UnWeighted kNN - 100%
  Weighted kNN   - 100%
  kd-Tree        - 97.015%
  
On Monks 1 Dataset
  UnWeighted kNN - 77.083%
  Weighted kNN   - 77.083%
  kd-Tree        - 71.528%
