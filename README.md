# Capstone-kNN
This is my kNN Assignment for my capstone course, where I implemented the kNN algorithm in python and tested it on some data

Here is a summary of the results I was able to achieve

On Practice Data Provided by the Professor
  UnWeighted kNN - 100%
  Weighted kNN   - 100%
  kd-Tree        - 97.015%
  
On Monks 1 Dataset
  UnWeighted kNN - 77.083%
  Weighted kNN   - 77.083%
  kd-Tree        - 71.528%
